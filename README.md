# Virgin Galactic Clone
This project was inspired by one of my favorite websites Virgin Galatic(https://www.virgingalactic.com/). When I first started attempting to teach my web development I dreamed of being able to build a website similiar.

# NASA API
I first wanted to display the current weather on Mars add to the page.
(https://api.nasa.gov/assets/insight/InSight%20Weather%20API%20Documentation.pdf)

https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/
Temperature Plot (not currently being generated)

That API was not currently working. So I pivoted to another NASA API, Mars Rover Photos(https://api.nasa.gov/)
